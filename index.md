# Privacy Policy ORBCOMM Apps

This privacy policy describes the data that ORBCOMM Inc. and its subsidiaries collects through software applications for mobile phones and tablets made available to our customers and their employees and authorized representatives ("Customers," "you," and/or "your") on the Google Play and Apple App Stores (each an "app" or the "apps").

## IMPORTANT: ENTERPRISE/BUSINESS APPLICATION NOTICE

**This app is designed exclusively for business and enterprise use by ORBCOMM customers, employees, authorized installers, technicians, and certified partners. This app is not intended for consumer or general public use.** All users must be authenticated through ORBCOMM's business systems and have authorized access to use this application.

## APPLE APP STORE PRIVACY COMPLIANCE & APP TRACKING TRANSPARENCY

### Data Collection and Tracking Disclosure

**IMPORTANT TRACKING NOTICE:** This app collects certain data types that Apple's App Store guidelines classify as "tracking data," including crash data, names, coarse location, performance data, and email addresses. While this data is collected primarily for legitimate business purposes within our enterprise ecosystem, Apple's privacy framework requires us to be transparent about this collection.

### App Tracking Transparency (iOS 14.5+) - REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION

**This app DOES implement App Tracking Transparency as required by Apple.** When you first launch the app on iOS 14.5 or later, you will see a system permission dialog requesting permission to track your activity. This dialog will appear before any tracking data is collected.

**You will be asked:**
"Allow [App Name] to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites?"

**Your Options:**
- **"Ask App not to Track"** - Restricts data collection to essential business functions only
- **"Allow"** - Permits full data collection for enhanced app performance and business functionality

**Note:** You can change this preference anytime in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking > [App Name]

### What Happens Based on Your Choice

**If You Allow Tracking:**
- Full business functionality including enhanced location services
- Improved app performance monitoring and crash reporting
- Complete job assignment and asset management features
- Enhanced diagnostic capabilities for technical support

**If You Ask App Not to Track:**
- Core business functions remain available
- Limited performance monitoring (anonymous only)
- Basic location services for essential job functions only
- Reduced diagnostic data collection
