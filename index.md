### Data Collection vs. Tracking Clarification

**WE DO NOT TRACK USERS ACROSS OTHER COMPANIES' APPS OR WEBSITES.** This app collects data solely for business functionality within ORBCOMM's device installation and management ecosystem. Specifically:

- **Data Used for App Functionality:** User names, credentials, job data, device information, and location data are collected to enable core business features like user authentication, job assignments, device installations, and asset management.
- **No Cross-App Tracking:** We do not collect data to track users across other companies' apps, websites, or services for advertising, measurement, or analytics purposes.
- **No Advertising:** This app does not contain advertising or share data with advertising networks.

### App Tracking Transparency (iOS 14.5+)

For iOS devices running version 14.5 or later, if the app detects any potential tracking activities, you will be presented with an App Tracking Transparency prompt requesting permission. You can:
- Grant permission to allow data collection for improved app performance
- Deny permission to restrict data collection to essential business functions only
- Change your preference anytime in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking

**Note:** This business application's core functionality does not require cross-app tracking, and the app will function fully regardless of your tracking preference.
